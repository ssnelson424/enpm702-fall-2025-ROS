Workspace and Development Environment
====================================================

ROS 2 Workspaces
----------------

A ROS 2 workspace is a directory that contains your source packages and the build artifacts generated by ``colcon``.  
A typical workspace layout is:

.. code-block:: text

   ros2_ws/
     src/
       my_package/
       another_package/
     build/
     install/
     log/

Key Directories
---------------

- ``src/``

  - Contains the source code of your ROS 2 packages.
  - This is where you clone or create new packages.

- ``build/``

  - Temporary build files generated by ``colcon build``.
  - You rarely edit files here directly.

- ``install/``

  - Contains the final, installable artifacts and environment setup files.
  - After a successful build, you source ``install/setup.bash`` to use your packages.

The colcon Build Tool
---------------------

- **colcon** is the build tool used by ROS 2 workspaces.

- Typical workflow:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/ros2_ws
     colcon build

- After building, you must source the workspace:

  .. code-block:: bash

     source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

  This step extends your environment so that ROS 2 can find your new packages.

Overlaying Workspaces
---------------------

ROS 2 supports an \emph{overlay} mechanism:

- The base installation (for example, ``/opt/ros/humble``) is your \emph{underlay}.
- Your development workspace \emph{overlays} that underlay.
- When you source:

  .. code-block:: bash

     source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
     source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

  ROS 2 searches for packages in the overlay first, then falls back to the underlay.

This allows you to:

- Override a package from the system installation with your own fork.
- Keep system packages intact while experimenting in your workspace.
